My Sphinx Theme
###############

This project aims to provide a simple Sphinx theme (a set of HTML files, style sheets and an entry point) to document scientific simulators.

In my opinion, to make things more complicated is much easier than to make things simpler.

I design this project to be minimal, transparent and easily-hackable, so that one can customise and build own theme on top of it.
